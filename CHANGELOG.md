## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-12

### 🎯 Headline

**One-key 1.x → 2.0 upgrade.** `npm i -g peaks-cli@2.0` runs the full
upgrade umbrella in the consuming project automatically (gated by the
1.x detector). The manual fallback is `peaks upgrade --to 2.0 --auto`.

The architecture moves to **skill-first / CLI-auxiliary**: skill SKILL.md
files are the primary surface the LLM consumes; CLI commands are
machine-enforced gates, structured-JSON probes, or side-effect primitives.
See `.claude/rules/common/dev-preference.md` (project-local) for the
operating tenet.

**ocr second-opinion code review (soft-optional).** Alibaba's
`@alibaba-group/open-code-review` is now an `optionalDependency`; when
installed + configured against a user-owned LLM endpoint, peaks-rd's
Gate B3 merges its findings into `code-review.md` as a second opinion
alongside the LLM-only review. Soft-fails so missing ocr never blocks
a slice. New CLI: `peaks code-review detect-ocr` / `run-ocr`. See
`skills/peaks-rd/references/ocr-integration.md` for the contract.

### Breaking Changes

- **`.claude/rules/` is no longer the source of truth for project standards.**
  The 2.0 canonical location is `.peaks/standards/{common,typescript}/*.md`.
  The 1.x `.claude/rules/` tree is thinned to 2-line pointers during upgrade,
  preserving the original under `.claude/rules/.peaks-2.0-backup-<ISO>/`.

- **`.gitignore` requires a granular `.peaks/` block**, not a wholesale
  `/.peaks/` ignore. The upgrade umbrella migrates the consumer's
  `.gitignore` automatically (with a timestamped backup); without it, 2.0
  tracked artifacts (`.peaks/standards/`, durable `.peaks/memory/*.md`,
  `.peaks/PROJECT.md`, opt-in markers) would be silently hidden from git.

- **Per-project config moved from `~/.peaks/config.json` to `<project>/.peaks/preferences.json`.**
  `~/.peaks/config.json` retains only `{ "version": "2.0.0" }`. Fields
  `economyMode`, `swarmMode`, headroom settings, etc. are now per-project.
  The upgrade umbrella runs `peaks config migrate --apply` automatically.

- **Postinstall behavior changed.** `npm i -g peaks-cli@2.0` now:
  1. Symlinks bundled skills to **all 8 supported IDE platforms**
     (Claude Code, Trae, Cursor, Qoder, Codex, Tongyi Lingma, Aider, Roo Code),
     not just the auto-detected one. Per real Trae user feedback 2026-06-11.
  2. Installs bundled output styles.
  3. If `cwd` contains a 1.x peaks-cli project, fire-and-forgets
     `peaks upgrade --to 2.0 --auto`. Opt out with `PEAKS_SKIP_AUTO_UPGRADE=1`.

### Added

- **`peaks upgrade --to 2.0`** — umbrella that orchestrates the 1.x → 2.0
  migration: config migrate, standards migrate (`--from-claude-rules`),
  memory extract (with disk-based glob expansion for the consumer's
  artifact tree), hooks install, skill sync, audit verify, plus
  in-process preferences-ensure, gitignore-migrate, and upgrade-record
  write. Soft-fail per sub-step; never blocks the whole upgrade.

- **`peaks upgrade --detect-1x`** — read-only probe returning a JSON
  envelope the peaks-solo skill consumes to gate the AskUserQuestion
  in Step 0.55.

- **`peaks standards migrate --from-claude-rules`** — thins `.claude/rules/`
  to 2-line pointers and scaffolds `.peaks/standards/{common,typescript}/`.

- **`peaks skill sync`** — distributes the skill family across all 8
  supported IDE platforms in one command.

- **`peaks audit red-lines`** — L2 catalog audit (P0/P1/P2-a/P2-b
  enforcers) for skills/SKILL.md, references/*.md, and the agent shield.

- **`peaks agent run`** — ECC 64 agents soft-optional integration
  (spec §7.2). When the L3 stack is installed, peaks delegates to it;
  otherwise degrades to peaks-cli's own core diagnostics.

- **`peaks memory search` / `peaks retrospective search`** — new search
  subcommands for the durable memory / retrospective stores.

- **`peaks workspace init / clean / archive`** — workspace lifecycle
  primitives with `--dry-run` default + `--apply` opt-in.

- **`peaks preferences set / get / reset`** — per-project preferences
  read/write CLI.

- **Two paired tenets** captured in `.peaks/memory/peaks-cli-tenet-one-key-completion.md`:
  - **One-key completion** — actions that can be done in one step
    should not be designed as two-step operations.
  - **Minimal user operation** — features can be powerful, but the
    user-facing surface should be minimal; the CLI/LLM figures it out.

### Fixed

- **(2026-06-12) `upgrade-service.ts` was missing from develop HEAD**,
  causing fresh clones to fail TS2307. Repaired in commit ec6f674.

- **(2026-06-12) `peaks standards migrate --from-claude-rules`** rejected
  as `unknown option`. CLI flag wiring fixed in core-artifact-commands.ts.

- **(2026-06-12) `peaks memory extract`** failed with
  `Artifact path must stay inside the project root` when the umbrella
  passed literal glob strings (`skills/**/SKILL.md`). The umbrella now
  expands globs on disk before spawning.

- **(2026-06-12) Three bugs surfaced by real-world ice-cola dogfood:**
  - memory-extract was called without `--apply` → always dry-ran, never
    actually wrote.
  - `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` (the standard Claude-Code consumer
    convention) was not walked; only `<root>/skills/` was scanned.
  - `.peaks/preferences.json` was never created after upgrade, so the
    1.x detector kept returning `isOneX=true` and the user got stuck
    in a re-prompt loop. Violated the one-key completion tenet.

- **(2026-06-12) `.gitignore` 1.x wholesale `/.peaks/` rule** silently
  hid every 2.0 tracked artifact. New `gitignore-migrate-service.ts`
  detects 4 wholesale forms (`.peaks`, `.peaks/`, `/.peaks`, `/.peaks/`),
  removes them, and appends the canonical 2.0 granular block with a
  sentinel comment. Idempotent; creates timestamped backup before write.

- **(2026-06-11) Windows: `peaks slice check`** was using `npx tsc` /
  `npx vitest` which spawned `cmd.exe` indirectly via the npx shim and
  failed with ENOENT. Now resolves local `node_modules/.bin/` binaries
  directly via `runCommand(shell: true)`.

### Deprecated

- **`peaks workspace migrate-1-4-1`** — retained for 1.4.1 → 1.4.2
  legacy session-layout backward compatibility. Will be removed in 2.1.
  Use `peaks upgrade --to 2.0` for the canonical migration path.

### Removed

- `~/.peaks/config.json` schema is now `{ "version": "2.0.0" }` only.
  All other fields are migrated to per-project `.peaks/preferences.json`
  by `peaks config migrate`.

### Architecture

- **Skill-first / CLI-auxiliary.** SKILL.md is the primary surface;
  CLI earns its keep only when (a) hook/script/CI-invokable, (b) the
  consumer needs a structured JSON envelope to gate a decision, or
  (c) destructive side-effect needs explicit `--apply`. See the
  decision template in `.claude/rules/common/dev-preference.md`.

- **Two-axis naming convention** for `.peaks/` workspace:
  `<changeId>` for reviewable artifacts under `.peaks/<changeId>/...`;
  `<sessionId>` for ephemeral state under `.peaks/_runtime/<sessionId>/...`.
  Regression test pins zero use of ambiguous `<sid>`.

- **`.peaks/_runtime/`** replaces `.peaks/runtime/` (defensive wrong-path
  pattern still in .gitignore).

### Verified

- 223 test files / 2768 tests pass / 16 skipped.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
- `npm run build` clean.
- End-to-end dogfood on real 1.x consumer project (ice-cola): 6/6
  upgrade sub-steps pass; `.gitignore` migrated with backup; detector
  returns `isOneX: false` after upgrade; all 2.0 tracked artifacts
  surface in `git status`.

### Migration Guide

See `docs/UPGRADING-2.0.md` for the manual fallback if the auto-upgrade
is skipped (`PEAKS_SKIP_AUTO_UPGRADE=1` or `npm i --ignore-scripts`).
